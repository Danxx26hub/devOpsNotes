# Agile and SDLC


### SDLC 

* Waterfall :  
A linear model which flows only in one direction until the maintenance stage, with a single integration and test step.

*  V-model : 
A linear model with testing for each design step

*  Spiral : 
Repeated cycles of identification, design, build, and evaluation

* Agile : 
Short cycles through the steps of requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, and review.



### DevOps Concepts 

* Infrasturcture as Code
    * Cloud compute, virtual switches, etc.
* DRY (Don't repeast yourself)
    * Write code/configuration that can easily be repeated.
* Customer first
* Shared responsibility (don't play the blame game)
